Faye's Quick Buy permits buying a large amount of items quickly through NPs via keybindings

- Quick Stack
    -> Default keybinding is LeftShift
    -> Buys the item you're hovering on
    -> It is VERY fast

- Quick Buy Stack
    -> Default keybinding is LeftCtrl
    -> Buys a max stack of the item you're hovering on
    -> Per press

Why? I wanted to invest in silt more efficiently and the normal buying process just didn't cut it out for me.
